# SE-Troubleshooting

This is a homework of an Artificial Intelligence course where I developed a Expert System using CLIPS by defining rules.

The goal of the homework was to take 20 to 50 common errors from a troubleshooing manual and convert it into rules of an Expert System.

The troubleshooting manual I took was [Microwave Repair Help](https://www.repairclinic.com/RepairHelp/Microwave-Repair-Help)

My name is Carlos Abel Polanco Graciano and I'm a software developer but also a student of [Universidad Iberoamericana (UNIBE)](https://www.unibe.edu.do/).
